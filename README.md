# PHP Hover Documentation

PHP is nice, but it lacks a bit of standardization, which can make its built-in functions hard to use.

This simple package adds a tooltip with the definition and description of PHP's built-in methods when you hover them.
It's nothing fancy, but it saved me a lot of time, and I bet it'll do the same for you!
